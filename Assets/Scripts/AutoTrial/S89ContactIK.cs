    /// Session 89: a runtime contact-IK layer that pins a hand to a face landmark for the clips that
    /// declare they need it. Generalises by design, ships gated to b2 alone.
    ///
    /// ================== WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS ==================
    /// S88 established the standing reason: the generator does not resolve contact points at this
    /// spatial precision. Measured on their own source rig, three clips whose prompts ranged from
    /// "covers their mouth" to "presses the palm over their mouth ... hand centered on the mouth,
    /// forearm vertical in front of the chest" all put the hand in the same place -- minimum
    /// hand-to-Head distance 0.1365 / 0.1357 / 0.1497 head-heights, i.e. at the cheek. Re-prompting
    /// is not a lever. Nor is the body: S88 swept sixteen Rocketbox appearances and the best still
    /// missed by 0.0795 m. Nor is per-joint source calibration: S87 spent six iterations proving that
    /// closing the lateral gap by shoulder rotation sweeps the forearm THROUGH the head.
    ///
    /// ================== STEP 0, THE BONE-ACCESS RULING ==================
    /// Measured in a live trial (S89BoneAccessProbe), not assumed:
    ///   * the pedestrian instance runs OPTIMIZED -- hasTransformHierarchy false, 2 transforms,
    ///     GetBoneTransform(Hips) null, SkinnedMeshRenderer.bones empty. Nothing already deoptimises it.
    ///   * OnAnimatorIK DOES fire: SocialForcesAnimatorController's Base Layer already carries
    ///     m_IKPass: 1, and that survives the S79/S83 AnimatorOverrideController. So
    ///     Animator.SetBoneLocalRotation is reachable with NO .controller edit, and writes reach the
    ///     rendered mesh (45.66 cm mean bounds difference between correction-on and correction-off).
    ///   * AnimatorUtility.DeoptimizeTransformHierarchy on the SPAWNED CLONE costs 1.05 ms once,
    ///     takes the instance from 2 to 85 transforms, rebinds the renderer (bones 0 -> 80, root
    ///     Bip01 Pelvis) and the mesh keeps animating. It touches no asset: the pedestrian is an
    ///     Instantiate() clone with no prefab link.
    ///
    /// This component uses DEOPTIMISE + direct transform writes, and that is a deliberate choice
    /// between two paths that both satisfy "zero YAML, zero prefab writes":
    ///   * the solve NEEDS world-space bone positions (shoulder, elbow, wrist, head) which an
    ///     optimized rig simply does not expose, so the deoptimise is required for READING whichever
    ///     way the write goes; and
    ///   * SetBoneLocalRotation applies in MUSCLE space and is therefore subject to the humanoid
    ///     muscle limits -- the elbow-flexion limit is exactly what S84 measured saturating at 63% of
    ///     b2's frames. Writing transforms directly bypasses that clamp.
    ///
