    /// must be the one to yield." Diagnosis this session found that ModulateAssertive()'s
    /// existing sfAgent.RobotRepulsion=0 suppression (PedestrianModulator.cs, untouched, outside
    /// writable scope) fully zeroes the robot-specific agent-force term ONLY while the robot's own
    /// rigidbody speed stays above 0.1 m/s (SFAgent.CalculateAgentForce()'s own dampenFactor
    /// ternary reverts to 1.0, i.e. full repulsion, whenever the robot dips below that threshold).
    /// Measured empirically this session: assertive's pre-FIX-B lateral spread (~1.72m
    /// post-release) was actually LARGER than indifferent's (~1.55m) -- confirming assertive does
    /// NOT hold a straight line today, not just a theoretical risk. This component sidesteps the
    /// social-force system entirely once released: it drives transform.position along a fixed
    /// straight line from release position to release destination, every LateUpdate, AFTER
    /// Base.cs's own Update()/LateUpdate() ([DefaultExecutionOrder] guarantees this ordering).
    ///
    /// SAFETY BACKSTOP -- IMPORTANT, READ BEFORE TUNING: a pure open-loop straight line (no
    /// proximity awareness at all) measured min_dist as low as 0.299-0.333m -- BELOW the 0.36m
    /// physical floor -- and this PERSISTED even under the historically-safe, compiled-in-default
    /// TEB settings (0.3/0.5/weight_obstacle=50, i.e. NOT a FIX-A-tuning problem at all). Root
    /// cause, confirmed directly from a real trial's frames.csv: the ROBOT's own path grazed a
    /// PEDESTRIAN THAT WAS ALREADY FROZEN/STATIONARY (mid-emergency-pause) down to 0.303m --
    /// i.e. TEB's own planning/replanning imprecision against a static obstacle, at settings that
    /// have worked for 30+ prior sessions' worth of COMPLIANT pedestrians, can still shave
    /// clearance this thin when the pedestrian contributes zero avoidance of its own. A
    /// forward-progress freeze alone (the first attempt) cannot fix this -- freezing only stops
    /// the pedestrian from making things worse, it does nothing about the robot's own trajectory
    /// already carrying it close to a fixed point. Zero-collision is absolute, so this component
    /// now has a genuine, if minimal, LATERAL EVASION as a last resort: if distance to the robot
    /// drops below EmergencyLateralStepDistanceMeters (stricter/closer than
    /// EmergencyStopDistanceMeters, which still governs forward-progress pausing), the pedestrian
    /// steps sideways (perpendicular to its own direction of travel, away from the robot) at
    /// EmergencyLateralStepSpeedMps, on top of whatever forward progress state it's in. This is a
    /// deliberate, necessary compromise on the literal "never yields" ideal -- documented here
    /// plainly rather than silently: the video will show assertive holding an exactly straight
    /// line for the overwhelming majority of any encounter, with at most a small, brief sideways
    /// correction only in the rare case the robot's own planner imprecision would otherwise bring
    /// it inside the collision floor. Absolute safety wins over literal designed behavior; see
    /// REPORT.md Session 32 FIX B for the full progression of measurements that led here (the
    /// pure freeze was tried first, at three different stop distances, and never fixed this).

    /// Inactive (a pure no-op) until Activate() is called -- wired at the exact SLATE v2 release
