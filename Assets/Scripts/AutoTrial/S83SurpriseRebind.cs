    /// Session 83 PHASE 3. Rebinds the SurprisedReaction state's clip to the Kimodo b2 reaction at
    /// runtime, composing onto whatever controller the gait install left behind.
    ///
    /// WHY A SELF-BOOTSTRAPPING COMPONENT RATHER THAN A BOOTSTRAP LINE. AutoTrialBootstrap.cs is
    /// outside this ticket's write boundary, so nothing may add an attach call there. This
    /// discovers pedestrians itself, which also makes the feature work on the STOCK pipeline --
    /// a trial with no --mixamo-clip has no S41MixamoClipApplier at all, so a rebind hung off the
    /// applier could never reach it. V4 in the matrix is exactly that case.
    ///
    /// THE HANDLE. PedestrianModulator is attached to every non-Indifferent pedestrian
    /// (AutoTrialBootstrap.cs:1030) and Surprised is by definition non-Indifferent, so it is
    /// present whenever this feature is meaningful. Indifferent pedestrians never fire the
    /// Surprised trigger, so not reaching them costs nothing.
    ///
    /// THE RACE, AND HOW IT IS CLOSED. S41MixamoClipApplier defers its install one frame (the
    /// Animator rebind invalidates bone lookups), so "the applier component exists" is NOT "the
    /// gait is installed". Composing too early would build the surprise override on the STOCK
    /// controller and then have the gait install replace it wholesale, silently losing the
    /// rebind. This waits on the applier's GaitInstalled flag, with a timeout so a failed install
    /// degrades to "no rebind, loudly" rather than a hang.
    ///
    /// COMPOSITION. S79GaitOverrideBuilder.ApplySurpriseOverride mutates an already-installed
    /// AnimatorOverrideController in place, so the gait remap and the surprise remap end up in ONE
    /// controller. It does not nest override-on-override.
    ///
    /// SCOPE (S97). DEFAULT ON, scoped to KIMODO pedestrians: a pedestrian whose installed gait is
    /// a kimodo_* clip gets the b2 reaction with no environment variables set at all. Everything
    /// else -- stock, Mixamo, and planD, which runs the `surprised` personality across 18 trials --
    /// keeps the S31 pointing gesture and is untouched. AUTOTRIAL_S83_B2_OFF=1 suppresses it
    /// entirely. See S79GaitOverrideBuilder.B2InScope for why the default is scoped, not global.
