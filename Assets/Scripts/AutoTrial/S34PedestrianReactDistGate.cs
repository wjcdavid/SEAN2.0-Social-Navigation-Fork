    /// genuine DISTANCE GATE, applied to every non-Assertive personality. Reframe this session:
    /// the complaint was never really about the robot detouring -- Session 33's control trial
    /// already showed robot-side "detour-onset distance" was pure TEB path noise (fired at 37.7m
    /// with the pedestrian parked 40m away), and the costmap audit found the clearance chain
    /// already tight. Assertive (min_dist ~0.77-0.79m across S32/S33) is the only personality with
    /// zero robot-repulsion response; every other personality's larger min_dist is created by the
    /// PEDESTRIAN stepping aside, not the robot. This component makes that stepping-aside distance
    /// an explicit, tunable gate instead of an always-on random 0.5-1.0 value
    /// (Parameters.ROBOT_REPULSION_DAMPENING_MIN/MAX, SFAgent.Start()).
    ///
    /// Mechanism (confirmed by reading SFAgent.cs -- forbidden to edit, fine to read):
    /// SFAgent.RobotRepulsion is a plain public property (Assets/IVI/Scripts/SFAgent.cs:29-37),
    /// not part of IVelocityModulator, so no GetComponent&lt;IVelocityModulator&gt;() singular-cache
    /// conflict (see S32AssertiveStraightLineGuardian's own notes on that constraint for a
    /// different problem). SFAgent.CalculateAgentForce() multiplies BOTH the robot-repulsion force
    /// term AND the tangential side-step term by `dampenFactor`, which equals `robotRepulsion`
    /// whenever the robot's own rigidbody speed exceeds 0.1 m/s (else 1.0, full force, regardless
    /// of this component -- an existing SFAgent behavior, not something this component controls).
    /// Setting RobotRepulsion=0 while the robot is farther than reactDistanceMeters, and to a
    /// personality-scaled nonzero value once inside it, reproduces "zero robot-response beyond
    /// the gate, full (or stronger/milder) response inside it" without touching SFAgent.cs or
    /// PedestrianModulator.cs.
    ///
    /// NOT attached to Assertive pedestrians -- ModulateAssertive() already permanently zeroes
    /// RobotRepulsion once (assertiveInitialized-guarded) and that stays exactly as-is, unchanged,
    /// per this session's own brief ("assertive = never").
