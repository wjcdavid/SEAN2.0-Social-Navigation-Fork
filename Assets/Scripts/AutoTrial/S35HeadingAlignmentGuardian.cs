    /// Session 35 FIX 1/2: root-causes and fixes "pedestrians never actually walk face-to-face
    /// at the robot -- already angled/turning from the start" (user's own diagnosis, confirmed
    /// this session via frames.csv: heading-vs-bearing angle stayed a real, nonzero ~5-60+ degrees
    /// through the whole approach under --profile scoring, not noise).
    ///
    /// Root cause, confirmed by reading Base.cs (forbidden to edit, fine to read): movement is
    /// root-motion-driven (`transform.position += animator.deltaPosition`), and Base.Move()
    /// decomposes the social-force `velocity` into LOCAL-FRAME "Forward"/"Strafe" animator
    /// parameters using the pedestrian's CURRENT facing (`animParams = Quaternion.Euler(0,
    /// -transform.eulerAngles.y, 0) * velocity`). Base.cs already tries to rotate facing toward
    /// a blended goal direction (`goalDir = 0.5*(nearestGoalPoint-position).normalized +
    /// 0.5*velocity.normalized`, capped at ANGULAR_SPEED=120 deg/s) -- but this blend is a
    /// feedback loop (facing depends partly on velocity direction, but the ACTUAL displacement
    /// direction, via root motion, itself depends on facing), and empirically takes several
    /// seconds/meters to converge (confirmed via a long-range --profile arc control trial: same
    /// transient exists, converges to within ~10-15 degrees of the true bearing by t=8-16s /
    /// ~10-15m of travel). --profile scoring's much shorter spawn/trigger distance (8m, vs arc's
    /// 25m) never gives this convergence enough runway -- the ENTIRE visible encounter happens
    /// mid-transient, which is exactly what reads as "already angled from the start."
    ///
    /// Fix: a LateUpdate transform-rotation override (same established pattern as
    /// `S21PedestrianPositionGuardian`/`S32AssertiveStraightLineGuardian` -- a script-driven fix
    /// from outside Base.cs/PedestrianModulator.cs, not an edit to either) that forces
    /// `transform.eulerAngles.y` to the STATIC bearing from spawn toward the pedestrian's own
    /// destination (a fixed target, precomputed once at wiring time from AutoTrialConfig --
    /// NOT derived from live `Base.velocity` every frame). An earlier version of this fix tried
    /// snapping to live velocity direction instead and measured WORSE alignment (mean angle
    /// ~63 degrees, up from the unfixed baseline) plus a large min_dist regression (1.1m -> 3.1m)
    /// in direct before/after testing -- velocity is itself downstream of the same Forward/
    /// Strafe root-motion feedback loop this fix is trying to correct, so snapping to it
    /// creates a circular dependency instead of breaking one. A fixed destination bearing has
    /// no such feedback risk (it never changes), which is why this version uses it instead.
    ///
    /// Explicitly NOT applied to Assertive (owns its own straight-line transform override,
    /// `S32AssertiveStraightLineGuardian` -- this component would fight it) or Surprised (frozen
    /// this session per explicit user instruction; Surprised already has its own facing-override
    /// system via IVelocityModulator.TryGetFacingOverride()/IsRotationSuppressed(), untouched).
    /// Self-contained skip via the `personality` field rather than conditional wiring, so it's
    /// safe to attach unconditionally at bootstrap alongside S32AnimatorSpeedScaler.
    ///
    /// SECOND MECHANISM, added after direct measurement showed the facing-only fix above does
    /// NOT help every appearance: `wheelchair_user` measured a ~55-65 degree heading-vs-bearing
    /// offset even WITH the facing fix active (Session 35 FIX 1/2 diagnosis). Root cause: `Base.
    /// Move()`'s `directVelocityDrive` branch (`transform.position += velocity * Time.deltaTime`,
    /// used for avatars whose Animator has "no usable root motion... e.g. a wheelchair's looping
    /// seated-idle has zero deltaPosition every frame", per Base.cs's own comment) drives
    /// displacement DIRECTLY from `velocity` in world space -- completely independent of
    /// `transform.eulerAngles.y`, so a facing correction is a pure no-op for these appearances.
    /// Since `velocity` itself is computed inside the social-force system (outside writable
    /// scope) and can carry a genuine lateral component from the start, the only script-driven
    /// fix available from outside is a POSITION correction: each LateUpdate, project the actual
    /// position onto the straight spawn->destination line (zeroing perpendicular/lateral offset,
    /// preserving whatever along-line progress the character's own velocity produced this frame).
    /// This complements rather than replaces the facing fix -- root-motion-driven appearances get
    /// (mostly) fixed by facing alone; directVelocityDrive appearances need this too. Applying it
    /// unconditionally to both kinds of appearance is harmless: for a root-motion character
    /// already walking near-straight (post facing-fix), the lateral offset to correct is already
    /// small, so this just tightens further rather than fighting the facing fix.
