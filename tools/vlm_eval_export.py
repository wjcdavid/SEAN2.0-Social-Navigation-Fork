Two structural decisions carry most of the correctness here.

FRAMES COME FROM THE RAW JPGs, NOT FROM A VIDEO. The capture loop already writes every frame to
pov/pov_%05d.jpg at the camera's native 1280x720, and frames.csv has exactly one row per JPG, so
frame_idx indexes both. Decoding pov_full.mp4 instead would add a second lossy generation on top
of the JPEG and force a timestamp->frame remap. The cost of doing it this way is a hard ordering
constraint: run_trial.py deletes pov/ at the end of post_process() unless --keep-full, so this
export MUST be called before that deletion. It is not worth keeping --keep-full on instead --
15 Hz x 60 s x 1280x720 JPG is ~180 MB per trial, and a few hundred trials would be 40-70 GB;
~63 exported PNGs is ~13 MB.

That same decision is also the real overlay guarantee. The telemetry burn-in lives only in the
*_ov.mp4 files produced later by overlay.py; pov/*.jpg is written by the capture loop before any
overlay exists, so an exported frame CANNOT contain burned-in telemetry. score_batch.reject_overlay
is still called on every source path, but be clear about what it is: a check on the FILENAME STEM,
not on pixels. It cannot detect burn-in; it can only catch a path that was named *_ov. The
structural fact above is the guarantee, the name check is a cheap second line, and human spot-checks
of exported frames are the only pixel-level verification.

Derived quantities are computed on the full 15 Hz frames.csv and only then sampled down to the
1 Hz rows of states.csv. 1 Hz is an output rate, never a computation rate -- differencing a heading
column at 1 Hz to recover a turn rate would be garbage, which is why robot_ang_vel_y is read
straight off the physics body in-engine instead.

This directory is "Unity output 2". `../video/` is "Unity output 1".

`states.csv` has one row per image in `frames/`, and `Image_name` is the exact filename. The first
four columns -- `time`, `Image_name`, `robot_velocity`, `robot_heading` -- are the agreed interface
and are always first, in this order and this capitalisation. Every other column is appended after
them; a reader that selects by column name is unaffected by their presence.

## Time

`time` is **seconds since the trial's t=0**, which is not the moment Unity started. t=0 is the frame
the robot-to-pedestrian ground distance first crossed the trigger threshold; the robot is already
cruising by then. The preceding pre-roll (`preRollDurationSec` in `meta.json`, {preroll}) is not
captured. `time` is sim-clock seconds from `Time.time`.

### `time` is NOT the video's timeline -- use `video_time` to seek the mp4

Capture spacing is **not uniform**: per-frame dt ranges roughly 0.047-0.094 s, because a capture
tick (two 1280x720 renders + readback + JPEG encode + write) sometimes overruns its budget. The mp4,
however, is assembled at a single constant rate. So a frame's `time` and its position in the video
are two different clocks, and they drift apart over a trial. Measured on a real 60 s trial here:
**0.87 s of drift**, which at this project's ~1.8 m/s closing speeds is ~1.6 m of separation --
easily enough to change what the frame shows.

Two columns exist so nobody has to reconstruct this:

- `frame_idx` -- the frame's index in `frames.csv` **and** in the mp4's frame sequence. This is the
  exact, unambiguous correspondence; prefer it.
- `video_time` -- `frame_idx / achieved_fps`, i.e. where to seek in `pov_full.mp4` to land on this
  exact frame.

Use `time` for physics and reasoning about the trial. Use `video_time` / `frame_idx` for anything
that touches the video.

The regular sequence is **one frame per second**, `frame_0001.png` at t=1s, `frame_0002.png` at
t=2s, and so on -- the nearest captured frame to each whole second (capture runs at ~15 Hz, so the
error is under ~33 ms). t=0 itself is not a regular sample.

## Extra frames

{n_event} row(s) in this trial are forced event frames, named `frame_NNNN_e.png`, where NNNN is the
second they fall in. They exist because 1 Hz is too coarse for the moment that matters: closing
speeds here are ~1.8 m/s, so the separation changes ~1.8 m between consecutive regular samples, and
the trial's minimum distance usually falls between two of them. The `event` column marks them
(`min_dist`, `encounter_start`, `encounter_end`); it is empty for regular frames. If an event lands
exactly on a regular sample, no extra image is written -- the regular frame simply carries the label.

`--dense-encounter` (off by default) additionally infills the encounter span at 5 Hz, named

## Units, frames, and the sign trap

The simulator is Unity (**left-handed, Y-up**); ROS is **right-handed, Z-up**. The ground plane is
Unity's **(x, z)** -- Unity's y is height. That is why the position columns here are `robot_x` and
`robot_z`, not `robot_x`/`robot_y`: naming the second ground axis "y" would collide with the
vertical axis and is exactly the kind of pun that has cost this project time before.

| column | unit | frame / convention |
|---|---|---|
| `robot_heading` | **degrees**, [0, 360) | Unity world yaw of `base_link`. 0 = facing Unity **+Z**; increases **clockwise** seen from above |
| `robot_yaw_ros_rad` | **radians**, unwrapped (no 2*pi jump) | ROS convention: 0 = ROS **+x** (= Unity +Z), increases **counter-clockwise** |
| `robot_ang_vel_y` | rad/s | Unity yaw rate, sign matching `robot_heading` (CW positive) |
| `robot_ang_vel_ros` | rad/s | ROS yaw rate, CCW positive. Equals `-robot_ang_vel_y` |
| `cmd_vel_angular` | rad/s | ROS REP-103, `base_link`, **CCW positive** |
| `robot_velocity`, `robot_speed_ground` | m/s | ground-plane speed magnitude, unsigned |
| `robot_vel_x/y/z` | m/s | Unity world axes, signed; y is vertical |
| `robot_x`, `robot_z` | m | Unity world ground plane |

#### Two heading columns, opposite sign, and only one of them wraps

Verified across 2706 frames (three trials, 902 frames each):

- `robot_heading` stayed inside **[0, 360)** on every frame, including the two frames where it
  wrapped (358.90 -> 1.38 and 0.91 -> 357.80).
- `robot_heading` and `robot_yaw_ros_rad` agreed as mirror images on **2706 of 2706** frames, with a
  worst residual of **0.008 deg** -- floating point and sampling noise, nothing structural.

Two consequences, and both have a way of biting quietly:

**`robot_yaw_ros_rad` is UNWRAPPED and can leave the +/-2*pi range.** It is accumulated across
frames on purpose so that a consumer differentiating or plotting it never sees a 2*pi spike at the
wrap point. If you want an absolute heading from it, take `mod 2*pi` yourself. Otherwise you will
read values like -361 deg, and nothing will report an error.

**Comparing the two columns requires `mod 360`.** One wraps and the other does not, so adding them
and expecting zero fails exactly at the wrap frames -- measured, a direct sum reads -2.48 there.
Under `mod 360` the relationship holds everywhere. A single sampled row cannot show this: any row
away from a wrap satisfies both the naive and the correct check, which is why this was verified over
whole trials and specifically over the wrapping frames rather than from one value.

**`robot_heading` and `cmd_vel_angular` turn in opposite directions.** This is not a bug and it is
not new -- it is inherent to the two coordinate conventions and is already present in every
`frames.csv` this project has ever produced. `robot_yaw_ros_rad` and `robot_ang_vel_ros` are
provided so that a consumer can work entirely in ROS convention and never mix the two. The
conversion is a single sign flip applied in-engine (`TrialController.CaptureFrame`), the same flip
`SEAN.TF.OdometryPublisher` already applies before publishing.

## Where the velocity numbers come from

`robot_vel_*` and `robot_ang_vel_y` are read off the robot's physics body in-engine
({velsrc}), not differenced from positions. Note what that does and does not mean:
`SEAN.Control.VelocityController` *sets* those body velocities each FixedUpdate from the incoming
`cmd_vel`, and PhysX then integrates them. So they are the body's realised state, but they are
**not independent of the command** the way a wheel encoder would be. The legacy `robot_speed`
column in `frames.csv` (a finite difference of position) remains the more independent measure of
what actually happened, and it is left untouched for exactly that reason -- it is also the input to
the trigger-speed gate and the comparison basis for every trial ever run.

## `lateral_offset_straightline`

Perpendicular distance, in metres, from the robot to the **straight line from its start pose to its
goal** ({goaltxt}).

It is deliberately **not** measured against the planner's path. move_base does publish a global
plan, but no component in the running scene subscribes to it, so no path geometry reaches this
pipeline at all.

Two things follow, and both matter before anyone trains on this column:

1. It is **not** the `lateral_offset_norm` of the driving-surrogate literature, which is offset
   from a lane centreline. Different reference, different semantics. The name is different on
   purpose.
2. Its noise floor is high. Session 34's control trial -- a pedestrian parked 40 m away, physically
   incapable of influencing the robot -- still measured ~0.3-0.45 m of ambient lateral drift from
   TEB itself. There is signal here, but the SNR is limited, and a deviation under ~0.5 m should
   not be read as avoidance behaviour.

## `phase`

`approach` | `encounter` | `depart`, using this project's existing thresholds
(`trial_lib.PHASE_ENCOUNTER_TIME_WINDOW_SEC` = {tw}s, `PHASE_ENCOUNTER_DIST_M` = {dm} m): a frame is
`encounter` if it is within +/-{tw}s of the trial's minimum-distance frame **or** the pedestrian is
closer than {dm} m; otherwise `approach` before that frame and `depart` after.

## `min_dist` and `nearest_ped_*`

`min_dist` is the **instantaneous** distance to the closest pedestrian at that frame, minimised over
all pedestrians present (1 for most configs, 2 for dyad, 3 for ped_count_3). It is not a running
minimum -- the whole-trial minimum is `minDistanceMeters` in `meta.json`. `nearest_ped_id` says
which pedestrian that was.

## Why these frames cannot contain burned-in telemetry

They are exported from `pov/pov_%05d.jpg`, written by the capture loop **before any overlay exists**.
The telemetry burn-in is applied later and only ever to separate `*_ov.mp4` files. That structural
fact is the guarantee.

A filename check (`score_batch.reject_overlay`) also runs on every source path, but it inspects the
*name*, not the pixels -- it can catch a path called `*_ov`, and nothing else. Do not mistake it for
overlay detection. The only pixel-level check is a human looking at exported frames.

`../video/pov_full_ov.mp4` **is** overlaid and is for human review only. Never sample frames from it.
