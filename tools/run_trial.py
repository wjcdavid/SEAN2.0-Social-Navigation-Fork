CLI-driven trial runner for the SEAN 2.0 AutoTrial pipeline.

    python tools/run_trial.py --appearance wheelchair_user --personality indifferent --duration 90

produces, with zero manual Unity interaction: robot-POV video (pov_full.mp4 + overlay), the
primary deliverable as of Round 4's output format v3 (no chase/third-person camera, removed
Session 10 D5); near-pedestrian clips (pov_near_NN[_ov].mp4) cut from it, retained as VLM-
prefilter material; frames.csv of per-frame robot data; and meta.json.

Pipeline:
  1. Validate args against a friendly hardcoded appearance list (Unity's own resolution in
     AutoTrialBootstrap.cs is authoritative -- this is just an early, cheap UX error).
  2. Refuse to start if the Unity Editor already has this project open (Temp/UnityLockfile held
     by a live process). A stale lockfile with no live holder is removed.
  3. Health-check ROS inside the `ros` container (move_base alive, /map present, goal topic has a
     subscriber). Reused by default; --fresh-ros tears down and relaunches cleanly.
  4. Write a per-trial JSON config, launch Unity in batchmode (or windowed, see --windowed) via
     -executeMethod SEAN.AutoTrial.AutoTrialEditorRunner.EnterPlay -trialConfig <path>. No -quit,
     no -nographics -- AutoTrialBootstrap/TrialController own the exit once the trial finishes.
  5. If a goal pose was requested, verify it actually reached move_base
     (rostopic echo -n1 on the goal topic) before trusting the run.
  6. Wait for Unity to exit (hard timeout = duration + 60s), then assemble full-length mp4s from
     the captured JPGs and cut near-pedestrian clips from frames.csv (min_dist < --near-dist, ±2s
     padding). Raw JPGs are deleted afterward unless --keep-full.

Session 6 instrumentation: after a successful trial, meta.json (written by Unity's
TrialController.WriteMetaJson) is read back and augmented with host-known, ROS-side facts this
script observes but never sets: the live /move_base/oscillation_timeout value, the ROS run_id and
bringup mode (fresh/reused) for this trial, how old the current roscore process is in wall-clock
seconds, and this trial's position (1-based) within its sequential run. This script contains no
code that calls `rosparam set` / `dynparam set` on oscillation_timeout or any other move_base
param -- every value recorded here is read live via `rosparam get`, never assigned.

Canonical ROS bringup (read-only extracted from social_sim_ros's sean_navstack.launch and
map_server.launch -- never edited by this script):

    roslaunch social_sim_ros map_server.launch scene:=outdoor
    roslaunch social_sim_ros sean_navstack.launch scene:=outdoor prefix:=<run-name>

sean_navstack.launch itself includes (in this order): sim_tcp_bridge.launch (the Unity<->ROS TCP
bridge, `tcp_server` node), kuri_move_base.launch (move_base + costmap params -- reused as-is for
the Unitree A1; there is no A1-specific move_base config in social_sim_ros, confirmed by recon),
kuri_description.launch, map_publisher.launch, trial_info.launch, depth_to_laserscan.launch.
map_server.launch is launched as a separate process alongside it (not included by
sean_navstack.launch), publishing /map from social_sim_ros/maps/<scene>/map.yaml.

# Session 29 STEP 2: scooter_user's own default --ped-speed multiplier. Parameters.MAX_VEL
# (Assets/Scripts/Agents/Parameters.cs) = 0.6 m/s is the shared social-force speed cap every
# character (Zone A and B alike) was measured hitting -- walking pace, not e-scooter cruise
# (real-world reference 3-4 m/s). 5.5x -> ~3.3 m/s, mid-range. PedestrianModulator.Scale()
# multiplies AFTER SFAgent.UpdateVelocity()'s own MAX_VEL clamp, so this can exceed 0.6 m/s
# without editing SFAgent.cs/Base.cs (both off-limits).
# Session 30R STEP 2: real-world speed audit. Session 29's SCOOTER_SPEED_MULT=5.5 was landed via
# commit message only -- its own REPORT.md section was never written, so the "5.5x -> ~3.3 m/s"
# comment above was never actually verified against a live trial (see PROJECT_HANDOFF's "Session
# 29 gap"). Measured live this session (frames.csv pedestrian_x/z, post-release): scooter_user at
# mult=5.5 actually ran ~5.23 m/s, not ~3.3 -- well outside the 3-4 m/s real-world e-scooter
# reference. Retuned to 3.7 below (implied base pace ~0.95 m/s * 3.7 ~= 3.5 m/s, mid-range).
# cyclist and wheelchair_user had NO multiplier at all (both measured ~0.95 m/s,
# walking-pace default -- cyclist is way under the 4-5 m/s bicycle reference; wheelchair_user is
# just under the 1.0-1.5 m/s reference). white_cane_user measured ~0.2-0.25 m/s, well under the
# 0.8-1.0 m/s reference (slower-than-walking, not stationary -- the Session 21-era transform-reset
# defect was NOT reproduced this session, positions traced smooth/monotonic; this is a genuine
# gait-speed gap, not that old bug resurfacing). All four retuned below from the SAME live
# measurements (implied base pace at mult=1.0, then solved for the multiplier landing near the
# middle of each reference range) -- see REPORT.md Session 30R STEP 2 for the full before/after
# table and the safety-rail (min_dist/ENCOUNTER-spin/collision) check on every change.
# Session 31 FIX 4: re-verified every actor against a REAL trial's frames.csv this session too
# (not multiplier arithmetic alone -- Session 29's scooter number was wrong for exactly that
# reason). Methodology refined from Session 30R's: measure per-frame instantaneous pedestrian
# speed (position delta / dt) across the whole post-release trial, then take the mean of frames
# where speed > 0.05 m/s ("moving" frames) -- NOT total-displacement/total-trial-duration, which
# undercounts badly for any actor that reaches its goal and then stands still for the remainder of
# the (90s) trial (found this session measuring business_male_01: naive whole-trial-average gave
# 0.189 m/s, nonsense against its own known ~1.3 m/s walking pace -- it simply arrives and stops
# around frame 74 of ~1100, and idles for the rest). Re-measured under --profile scoring, current
# (pre-fix) multipliers:
#   human (business_male_01, no multiplier): 1.285 m/s (reference 1.2-1.4 -- in range, confirms
#     Session 30R's number, no change).
#   scooter_user (mult 3.7): 3.515 m/s (reference 3-4 -- in range, confirms Session 30R, no change).
#   cyclist (mult 4.8): 4.560 m/s (reference 4-5 -- in range, confirms Session 30R, no change).
#   wheelchair_user (mult 1.3): 1.231 m/s -- AT/ABOVE human's own pace, wrong (should be SLOWER
#     than human, reference 0.8-1.0). Implied base pace 1.231/1.3=0.947, matching
#     Parameters.DESIRED_SPEED=0.95 almost exactly (sanity check).
#     IMPORTANT, found this session: the whole-trial mean/median methodology above is misleading
#     for any actor that reaches its own pedGoal and then stops or wanders -- naive
#     total-displacement/total-duration gave 0.189 m/s for business_male_01 (nonsense against its
#     own known ~1.3 m/s). Re-measured wheelchair_user using an early-window (first 8s
#     post-release, before any goal-arrival/wander contamination) method instead: mult=1.3 (the old
#     value) gives 1.175 m/s there, confirming the whole-trial number was roughly right for this
#     appearance. But a naive linear retune to mult=0.95 (the first attempt) collapsed to just
#     0.050 m/s (a 23x undershoot, not the ~10% reduction simple scaling predicts) -- reproduced
#     twice. wheelchair_user's root-motion/animation-blend response to the commanded velocity is
#     NOT linear across this range: mult=1.15 measured 1.037 m/s (consistent with 1.3's own linear
#     trend), but somewhere between 0.95 and 1.15 there's a real cliff where the blend tree stops
#     producing proportional root motion (a genuine animation-engineering quirk, not a math bug --
#     flagged to Howard, out of scope to fix at the animation-graph level this session). mult=1.0
#     sits just clear of that cliff: measured 0.890 m/s, reproduced identically (0.890 m/s) on a
#     second independent trial, min_dist 2.46-2.52m (safe). Landed at 1.0, not the arithmetically
#     "obvious" 0.95 -- the empirical cliff, not the target-midpoint math, is what actually governs
#     which values are usable here.
#   white_cane_user (mult 3.2): mean 0.943 m/s (moving frames, whole-trial) -- AT/ABOVE human's
#     pace, wrong (should be SLOWER than human, reference 0.6-0.8). Its own tap-and-pause gait
#     animation produces real burstiness confirmed again this session (early-window reads varied
#     0.549-0.851 m/s across different multipliers AND across repeat runs at the SAME multiplier --
#     e.g. mult=2.9 measured 0.608/0.518/0.640/0.553/0.563 m/s across two runs at three window
#     widths each -- consistent with Session 30R's own "real run-to-run variance, likely inherent
#     to its tap-and-pause gait" finding, not a measurement bug). Landed mult=2.9: consistently,
#     repeatably slower than human (~0.55-0.64 m/s vs human's 1.29) even though individual-run
#     point estimates don't always land inside the literal 0.6-0.8 band -- the qualitative goal
#     (clearly slower than human) is met more reliably than the precise numeric target is, and
#     chasing tighter precision against this much intrinsic gait noise has diminishing returns.
# Every change re-verified live post-retune (trial + speed recompute + min_dist + ENCOUNTER-spin +
# collision safety rail) before being called landed -- see REPORT.md Session 31 FIX 4 for the full
# before/after table, including the wheelchair cliff-discovery data.

# AutoTrialBootstrap.cs:798 gates modulator attachment on
# `!Mathf.Approximately(config.pedSpeedMultiplier, 1.0f)`. At exactly 1.0 this appearance gets
# NO PedestrianModulator at all, so:
#   - it runs on raw social-force velocity, capped by Parameters.MAX_VEL = 0.95 m/s (not the 0.6
#     that a stale comment in AutoTrialBootstrap claimed until Session 54)
#   - Session 47's absolute-target modulation (e) never applies to it
#   - BASE_PED_SPEED_MPS never applies either, which is why Session 54's 1.3 -> 1.0476
#     recalibration deliberately left this entry alone
#
# **That no-modulator behaviour is what passed human review.** Set this to 1.001 and the agent
# gains a modulator, its speed law changes, and NOTHING reports it -- no error, no warning, no
# gate. The only symptom is a trial that quietly behaves differently from the one that was
# approved.
#
# Known design coupling, recorded rather than fixed (Session 59-A): "multiplier == 1.0" and
# "attach no PedestrianModulator" are decided by one test, i.e. "do not rescale speed" and "do not
# apply personality modulation" are conflated. This is the same coupling behind the Session 46-E
# Indifferent defect, where supplying any multiplier attached a modulator to an agent that was
# specified to have none. The correct fix is to decouple them with an explicit "no modulator" flag
# instead of a magic value; it is behavioural, so it waits until after dataset generation.

# down proportionally (2.9 * 0.45/0.6 ~= 2.175, rounded to 2.2) and re-verified live against a real
# trial rather than trusting the arithmetic (this project's own standing rule after S29's scooter
# mistake) -- see REPORT.md Session 33 FIX 6 for the measured on-disk speed.
# Session 54: 2.2 -> 0.4296, and deliberately NOT a like-for-like rescale like the two above.
# Scooter and cyclist are directVelocityDrive==true, so their translation is velocity*dt and their
# S31/S33 calibrations were measured through an intact chain -- preserving their absolute commanded
# speed is correct. white_cane is directVelocityDrive==false, so every metre came from root motion,
# through the animator.speed loop that Session 53 found and the Idling deadlock Session 54 found.
# Its "2.2 gives ~0.4-0.5 m/s" calibration measured the attenuation of a broken chain, not the
# multiplier. With the loop open, commanded speed IS realised ground speed, so 2.2 would now render
# a white-cane user travelling at 2.86 m/s. Set from the documented INTENT above (~0.45 m/s)
# instead: 0.45 / 1.0476 = 0.4296. This is an assumption, flagged for the eyeball pass.
# Session 60: 0.4296 -> 0.0468. NOT a behaviour change -- 0.0468 * 1.0476 = 0.049 m/s is what
# this agent has actually been travelling at all along. The old 0.45 was the commanded value,
# and ~90% of it was lost to humanoid retargeting on this nested-Animator avatar, so the
# manifest recorded a speed an order of magnitude away from what happened. Paired with the
# referenceSpeedMps=0.150 calibration in AutoTrialBootstrap: commanded / calibrated k gives
# animator.speed 0.327, the value it already ran at, so nothing on screen moves differently.
# Session 60: REVERTED to 0.4296 (commanded 0.45 m/s) pending diagnosis -- see the calibration
# table in AutoTrialBootstrap. This restores exactly the state human review approved: realised
# ~0.049 m/s on screen, with the known and documented ~9x gap between commanded and realised.

    full root-cause writeup, a camera-framing limitation, not a geometry bug.)

    overtake: ped ahead on the robot's OWN path (the same spawn point headon uses), but facing
    and moving in the SAME direction as the robot instead of back toward it -- the faster robot
    catches up and passes. Goal continues further along the same bearing past the spawn point.
    Default ped-speed multiplier 0.5 (slower than the robot) unless overridden.

    overtaken: HONEST GEOMETRY NOTE -- literally spawning the pedestrian BEHIND robot_start
    turns out to be structurally incompatible with the existing SLATE v2 trigger: the pedestrian
    is frozen until release, so only the ROBOT's own pre-release motion can shrink
    dist_to_pedestrian toward the trigger threshold, and the robot only ever moves FORWARD
    (robot_start -> goal) -- a fixed point behind robot_start only gets further away as the robot
    advances, so the distance-shrink trigger condition can never fire (confirmed empirically this
    session: the 30s timeout guard fires instead, same failure mode --scenario crossing hit
    before its own fix). Implemented instead as the mirror of `overtake`: ped spawns AHEAD on the
    robot's own path (the same achievable-trigger spawn point headon/overtake use), same
    direction of travel as the robot, default ped-speed multiplier 1.5 (faster than the robot) --
    post-release the faster pedestrian pulls further ahead/away rather than the robot passing it,
    the mirror dynamic of overtake's "robot catches up and passes." This is a documented
    approximation of "overtaken," not literal starts-behind-catches-up motion -- said so plainly
    here and in REPORT.md rather than silently claiming geometry that isn't actually produced.

    creation), move_base was crash-looping every ~1.1s. `rosout.log` showed the real reason
    (never in move_base's own per-process log, which mysteriously never gets written) --
    MoveBase::MoveBase() FATAL: "Failed to create the teb_local_planner/TebLocalPlannerROS
    planner ... does not exist. Declared types are base_local_planner/TrajectoryPlannerROS" --
    `rospack find teb_local_planner` confirmed the package is genuinely absent from this
    container's ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, not a pluginlib cache race. Root cause: TEB (landed Session 23)
    was installed live into a long-running container that never got rebuilt into the `ros:latest`
    image (docker images don't auto-update from a live container's apt installs) -- so any FRESH
    container built from that image (exactly what a post-reboot session gets) starts back on the
    pre-TEB image and silently lacks it. The eventual "stabilizes on its own after several
    minutes" behavior earlier sessions never needed to explain is roslaunch's respawn --
    map_server.launch's OWN retries eventually happening to line up with some other transient
    state is not what's going on; every crash in this state is the exact same deterministic FATAL,
    forever, until the package is actually installed -- it does not self-resolve, unlike genuine
    priming/oscillation flakiness.

    Idempotent and cheap (a few hundred ms) once installed, so this runs unconditionally as a
    preflight rather than only after detecting a crash-loop -- matches contain_ros_logs()'s own
    "always run it, it's a no-op when already fine" pattern. Container-level package install, not
    a tracked-file edit (sim_ws/social_sim_unity git state untouched) -- but NOT persisted to the
    `ros:latest` image itself (would need `docker commit` or a Dockerfile change, both explicit,
    scoped host/infra actions out of this session's writable-file scope); flagged in
    HOWARD_HANDOFF.md as the durable fix still owed. Lost again if this container is ever
    recreated from the stale image -- this preflight is what makes that survivable automatically
    rather than costing another multi-hour diagnosis.

# Session 31 FIX 1 (Howard priority #1/#6, "avoids too early" / "encounter window too short"):
# screened min_obstacle_dist/inflation_dist in {0.3/0.5 (baseline), 0.2/0.3, 0.15/0.2} against one
# business_male_01 x indifferent x --profile scoring trial each (repeated once for the chosen
# candidate). Absolute safety floor: robot footprint radius (0.16m, /move_base/*_costmap/
# robot_radius) + pedestrian collision-capsule radius (0.2m, Base.RADIUS) = 0.36m -- every
# candidate's measured min_dist stayed well clear of this (baseline 1.737, candidate 0.2/0.3:
# 1.722/1.475 across two runs, candidate 0.15/0.2: 1.334) -- no candidate came anywhere near
# vetoing on collision risk. A lateral-path-deviation-onset-distance metric (how far out the robot
# first deviates >0.3m from the straight corridor centerline) was tried to isolate "avoidance
# onset" specifically, but proved too noisy to trust at N=1-2 per candidate -- readings did not
# move monotonically with the parameter change, consistent with this project's own prior findings
# (Sessions 22-24) that TEB's own residual path weave is a real, intrinsic optimization artifact,
# not cleanly separable from pedestrian-specific avoidance with a simple threshold. Landed the
# MODERATE candidate (0.2/0.3, not the more aggressive 0.15/0.2): directionally exactly what the
# brief asked (robot permitted closer before its cost function penalizes proximity), safety margin
# preserved with more headroom than the aggressive candidate, chosen over 0.15/0.2 specifically
# because the aggressive candidate's extra clearance reduction did not show a clearly demonstrated
# framing/dwell benefit to justify its tighter min_dist. Reported honestly as directionally-correct
# and safety-verified, not as a proven "later avoidance" effect -- see REPORT.md Session 31 FIX 1.
# Session 32 FIX A: raised aggressiveness one notch from S31's landed 0.2/0.3 (see
# TEB_SCORING_WEIGHT_OBSTACLE's own comment below for the full before/after data -- these two
# geometric params turned out NOT to be the dominant lever, but were kept at this tighter setting

# Session 32 FIX A: S31's own REPORT.md admitted the "later avoidance onset" causal claim was
# never cleanly isolated from TEB's ambient weave -- the user's own eyes then confirmed it did
# NOT visibly work (indifferent and assertive looked identical). This session actually measured
# detour-onset distance as a hard number for the first time (lateral deviation from the corridor
# centerline, sustained >=3 frames past a 0.12m epsilon, first 15 frames excluded as spawn-
# transient noise -- see the analysis notes in REPORT.md Session 32). S31's own two TEB params
# (min_obstacle_dist/inflation_dist, already at their more aggressive 0.15/0.2 candidate here)
# were NOT the dominant lever -- baseline onset under 0.2/0.3 (S31's landed values) measured
# 3.79-4.78m across indifferent/scared/surprised trials, essentially unchanged from pre-S31.
# `weight_obstacle` (TEB's own optimization weight for obstacle-avoidance cost -- how strongly
# the trajectory optimizer penalizes proximity to obstacles, independent of the geometric
# min_obstacle_dist/inflation_dist margins) turned out to be the real lever: reducing it from its
# compiled-in 50.0 down to 15.0 (alongside 0.15/0.2) measured onset at 1.76m and 2.79m across two
# repeat trials (mean ~2.27m) -- squarely in the brief's ~2-3m target band, with min_dist staying
# safely above the 0.5-0.86m operational bar (1.39-1.393m across the two indifferent runs). A
# `social_layer` costmap plugin (amplitude=77/covariance=0.1/cutoff=10.0) also exists on both
# costmaps and was investigated as a suspect (a Gaussian pedestrian-comfort cost layer, cutoff=10m
# is a plausible far-field trigger) but is NOT a dynamic_reconfigure server (confirmed via
# `dynparam list`) -- a live rosparam set would not take effect without a relaunch that risks being
# overwritten by whatever yaml seeds it at roslaunch time, and TEB's own weight_obstacle lever
# alone already hit the target band, so the social_layer investigation was not pursued further
# this session (flagged to Howard as a real, uninvestigated lever if a future session needs an
# even later onset than weight_obstacle=15 provides).

# Session 33 FIX 1: audited the FULL clearance chain the user's brief suspected (costmap
# inflation_radius/cost_scaling_factor, robot footprint, obstacle-marking range), not just TEB's
# own two geometric params (already tuned by S31/S32). Live audit via `rosparam get` against the
# already-running node (not this repo's own checked-out, stale sim_ws copy -- see PROJECT_HANDOFF's
# "sim_ws is stale" note): local_costmap/inflater_layer inflation_radius=0.1, cost_scaling_factor=3.0
# -- ALREADY SMALL, not a legacy-oversized Kuri bubble as the brief suspected. robot_radius=0.16,
# footprint='' (circular approximation) -- and the robot_description IS actually generated from
# kuri2.urdf.xacro (confirmed via `rosparam get /robot_description`), i.e. this sim genuinely runs
# a Kuri-class round robot, NOT an A1 quadruped as the task brief assumed -- the circular
# 0.16m footprint is period-correct for the robot actually in use, not a mismatch to fix.
# obstacle_range/raytrace_range=10.0m looked suspicious in isolation but the local costmap's own
# window is only 6x6m (confirmed), which already caps any practical marking distance at 3m from
# the robot regardless of the 10m range setting -- not a live lever.
#
# CRITICAL FINDING (the session's real headline, more important than any parameter value):
# built a clean pedestrian-ABSENT control trial (--ped-distance 40, --duration 15, pedestrian never
# within 20m the whole recording) and ran the SAME lateral-deviation "detour-onset" instrumentation
# S32 built against it. It still fired an "onset" at 37.7m -- i.e. with a pedestrian that could not
# possibly be influencing the robot's path at all, the same ambient TEB path noise (~0.3-0.45m
# lateral drift amplitude, smooth and continuous, NOT a discrete avoidance event) crosses the
# metric's 0.12m threshold within ~2s of every trial, regardless of any pedestrian. This CONFIRMS
# S32's own suspicion ("TEB avoidance-onset benefit not cleanly isolated from ambient weave") as
# the dominant explanation for S32's own reported variance (1.76-6.70m for one identical landed
# config) -- "detour-onset distance" as defined is measuring mostly-or-entirely ambient path noise,
# not a real, tunable geometric avoidance bubble. There is no large oversized bubble left to
# deflate at the parameter level; the true remaining effect (if any) is small relative to this
# noise floor. Reported honestly rather than chasing a number that doesn't mean what it appears to.
#
# Given that, tuning proceeded on REAL, trustworthy evidence instead: min_dist (not onset distance)
# across matched N=3 trials at fixed --profile scoring/business_male_01/indifferent/30s duration.
# Screened three costmap+TEB combinations (min_dist m, N=3 each): baseline (S32's landed 0.15/0.2/
# inflation_radius=0.1/csf=3.0): 0.54, 1.008, 1.168. A "tight" candidate (min_obstacle_dist=0.08,
# inflation_dist=0.12, inflation_radius=0.08, csf=8.0): 0.526, 1.668, 1.831 -- one run at 0.526,
# uncomfortably close to the 0.5m operational floor (only 5% margin), rejected per the brief's own
# "back off one notch" instruction. Landed the "notch back" candidate instead: min_obstacle_dist=
# 0.10, inflation_dist=0.15, inflation_radius unchanged at 0.10, cost_scaling_factor steepened
# 3.0->6.0 (cost falls off faster with distance = a tighter effective bubble edge at the same
# radius): 0.821, 1.069, 1.212 (one run separately gated FAIL on trigger-speed, unrelated to this
# parameter -- excluded). All three candidates' min_dist ranges overlap substantially given N=3 --
# consistent with the noise-floor finding above, this is NOT a dramatic, clean win, but it is a
# real, safety-verified, directionally-correct tightening (every touched parameter moved toward
# permitting closer proximity, none moved away from it), landed honestly as such.

    Session 8 found that priming a fresh bringup with one real move_base navigation cycle before
    the first batch trial -- independent of oscillation_timeout's value -- is what actually
    prevents oscillation-aborts (Cell 3: primed, timeout left at file's 1.0 -> 0/6 aborts; Cell 4:
    primed + dynparam 3.0 -> 0/6, reproducing Session 6's Cell 2). Unprimed bringups aborted 5-6/6
    regardless of whether oscillation_timeout was 1.0 or 3.0 (Session 6 Cell 1, Session 7 N=6).
    Landing oscillation_timeout=3.0 in sim_ws is therefore NOT required; this function is the real
    fix, encoded here so the recording pipeline doesn't depend on remembering the dance by hand.
    Also happens to set oscillation_timeout=3.0 live (harmless per Cell 3/4; kept for continuity
    with Session 4-6's evidence trail, not because it's been shown necessary).

    Idempotent, keyed on a positive probe (Session 6's own discovery: /move_base/set_parameters
    registers iff a real nav cycle has been processed) rather than on session-reuse -- a session
    that was merely reused, not actually primed by this tool, must not slip through. Session 9
    hardening: also cross-checks the live registry hit against `/run_id` (roslaunch's own fresh
    per-bringup UUID) via a local marker of the last run_id THIS tool actually primed, since a
    registry query alone can't distinguish "this instance was primed" from "a same-named service
    from an earlier, now-dead instance is still (spuriously) listed" -- rosmaster does not always
    prune registrations synchronously when a node is killed rather than cleanly shut down. Tested
    live this session across a teardown+fresh-relaunch boundary and did NOT reproduce a stale
    registration (the registry correctly showed unregistered on the new instance) -- but priming
    is cheap and idempotent, so this check errs toward re-priming whenever run_id is unknown or
